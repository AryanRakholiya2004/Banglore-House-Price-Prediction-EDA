## Insights

From the visualizations, we can observe:

- **Market Range:** Properties range from as low as 140.0 (units in Lakhs or another currency) to as high as 950.0, indicating a wide price spectrum.
- **Society Analysis:** Certain societies have significantly higher average prices compared to others, potentially due to location, amenities, or property features.
- **Bedroom Count vs. Price:** As the number of bedrooms increases, the average price tends to increase (though there might be exceptions based on location or property type).
- **Area Types:** The `Super-built Area` category seems to be the most common, followed by `Built-up Area` and then `Plot Area`.
- **Availability**:
  - Properties are split between **Ready to Move** and **Under Construction**, giving you an idea of immediate occupancy vs. future availability.
  - **Hall-Kitchen** configurations might be more prevalent in larger units, but verifying this requires deeper analysis in the dashboard.
